# nellie-bot
nellie-bot is a simple light-weight news aggregator service built using python and flask. The service is available [here](http://nellie-bot.herokuapp.com) Please note - at this point, do not use browser navigation buttons for best experience<p>
To set up nellie on your system, clone this repository, rename the sample _ configuration.ini file as configuration.ini. This file also needs to be populated with api keys from nytimes, npy and the washington post. The flask app must be launched from the home directory for the referenced paths to be indexed correctly.
